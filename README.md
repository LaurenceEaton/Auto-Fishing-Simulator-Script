A personal Python learning project for understanding how to use the pyautogui and pygetwindow libaries as well as interaction with the mouse and keyboard.
This project could be better done by using methods other than colour change detection to check for changes in the game state. However, I wanted to keep it simple and thought a game script would be a fun way to learn.


Project:
An automatic fishing script for the game [Roblox Fishing Simulator.](https://www.roblox.com/games/2866967438/MINIBOSS-Fishing-Simulator) 


Current hotkeys:

start script: ';' key
stop script: ',' key

Look for "start" and "stop" hotkeys in the code to change them.

## HOW TO USE ##

1. Run Code
2. Open game, place mouse pointer over valid water fishing spot
3. Press start hotkey
